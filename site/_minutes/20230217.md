# Attendees:

    - Goncalo Lopes
    - Bruno Cruz
    - Joaquin Rapela

# Topics covered

    - Goncalo demonstrated the integration into Bonsai of the Python online Kalman filter algorithm developed by Joaquin https://github.com/joacorapela/lds_python

        - we were able to infer positions velocities and accelerations online from positions extracted from a FWG video. Very impressive!!!

        - data type conversion could be tricky

    - we agained talked about a forthcoming Bonsai conference. Goncalo and Bruno suggested to run a Bonsai conference soon (e.g., by the end of 2023). Joaquin prefers to first focus on giving the first steps in the BonsaiML project (six months?), and later focus on the conference. He does not wants to get distracted during the first six months of the project on the conference organization.

# Next steps

    - Goncalo and Bruno:

        - build a well polished Bonsai package for inference of kinematics using Joaquin's Python code

            - add visualizers capable of plotting positions/velocities/accelerations with error bars

            - design interface to allow smoothing

            - design interface to allow learning

            - add forecastings into visualizers

    - Joaquin

        - add forecasting functionality to the Python LDS package

        - learn Bonsai: complete Bonsai tutorial

        - learn C# and reactive programming

        - build BonsaiML repo

            - add minutes to repo

            - create GitHub project with TODO lists

        - install and run Bonsai's kinematic inference in his workstation. Documentation about python scripting is available at bonsai-rx.org

        - learn about [rxinfer](https://biaslab.github.io/rxinfer-website/)
